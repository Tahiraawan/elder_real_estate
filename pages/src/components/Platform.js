          largest privately owned and operated real estate funds in the San
          Francisco Bay Area and Phoenix Metro. The firm employs several
          strategies in acquisitions, construction, and property management. The
          firmâ€™s value-add strategy targets quality discounted properties,
          recapitalized equity, and maximized profitability with cash-flow
          positive rentals.</p>
          <p className="font-[400] text-[17px] leading-[33px] pb-[20px]">
          The firm believes intellectual and human capital is essential to
          future growth. The fund projects annual double-digit growth with the
          goal of acquiring an additional 1,000 properties by 2023.</p>
          <p className="font-[400] text-[17px] leading-[33px] pb-[25px]"> So far, we are on pace to exceed that goal as we have purchased over
          559 units since the beginning of 2021.</p>
